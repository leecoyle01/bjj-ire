BJJ Ire is a website which provides the user with a brief history of the sport, information on classes and some instructionals.

I've made a 3 page website with the pages home(index.html) gallery(gallery.html) and register(register.html) in a navbar stuck to the top of the viewport.

For the home page i started with a div for the header with a thematic background and the text "bjj classes and times" this immediatley let the user know theyve found the right site for the info they would be looking for.

next on the home page is the brief historical summary of Bjj, starting the faq: "what is bjj" this div has a white bg and black text for clarity and an image of rilion gracie mentioned in the text. the image is added in html with an alt tag giving his name.
this section is distinguished from the rest of the page with a purple border a theme continued throughout the website.

the last section of the home page keeps the grey background of the body and contains a playable iframe and a timetable which is available also on the following pages for user accessabilty. and finaly the footer containing the formal club name(linked to index) and a facebook icon link

the next page is the gallery, the info section of the home page is replaced with three divs evenly spaced with flex containing images and text explaining some of the sport.

and finally the register page where the info section is replaced with a form for the users name and class theyd like to attend.
